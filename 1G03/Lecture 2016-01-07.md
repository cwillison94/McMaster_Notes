##Announcements

* Get updated courseware if you bought before Mon / exchange since there was printing problem
* Need to hand some of the pages in from courseware
* Get friendly with TAs because they're awesome
* February 5th: open museum day, hot drinks, 9-4

##Plate Tectonics

* The swinging magnet determines how close you are to a pole
* Claim: poles aren't wandering

**Polar wandering**: how rocks seem to have formed with an orientation in accordance to their polarity relative to the Earth's poles

history of continental rocks have a similar origin (further proof of Pangea) when looking at their polar wandering

**Abyssal plain**: flat oceanic area without ridges

**Theory**: the mid Atlantic Oceanic ridge is from continents pulling apart, forming new crust

**Crystal mush**: is this a technical term??

There's a valley between the rift because that's where the land is being pulled apart

**Subduction zones**: where crust is going into the mantle

**Magnetometer**: devices that measures for stronger or weeker local magnetic field

* Noticed ups and downs in the orientation of the ocean crust, almost stripe-y
* It was also symetrical with the stuff on the other side of the oceanic ridge
* The poles seem to reverse, since field is just from a circulating ball of molten iron
* The poles swap very quickly
* **Reversal**: when the poles swap

###Timeline

1. Gilbert
2. Gauss
3. Matuyana
4. Brhsdua: modern (a couple minor flips)

###Boundaries

1. **Transform**: Scraping by each other
2. **Convergent**: One goes under the other
	1. Crust "recycled"
3. **Divergent**: Pull apart
	1. Crust forms

Earthquakes occur at *every* boundary

Why are the continental flows in the directions we know?
