**Hutton's Revolution**:

**Uniformitarianism**: studying the present to explain the past

## Plate Tectonics

**Continental Drift**:

**Paleomagnetic Evidence**:

**Seafloor Spreading**:

**Subduction**: when a plate goes under another, brings water down with it, and the boiling water melts the rocks above it as it goes down

### Boundaries

| ---------- | --------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Divergent  | Apart     | Yeah          | Shallow                                  |               |
| Convergent | Together  | If subduction | If *subduction*, range from shallow in trenches to deep farther into the zone. Else, | If subduction and vertical movement |

## Mineral Classification

###Characteristics

How to differentiate?

* Lustre
* Cleavage
* Hardness
* Colour
* Streak
* More

### Intrusive

**Intrusive**: magma that doesn't make it to the surface

**Dikes** can form between **sill**, older rocks.

### Igneous

| Composition  | Extrusive           | Intrusive  |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ---------- |
| Felsic       | Rhyolite            | Granite    |
| Intermediate | Andesite            | Diorite    |
| Mafic        | Basalt              | Gabbro     |
| Ultramafic   | Komatiite (Picrite) | Peridotite |

* **Felsic**: rich in quartz, primarily on continents, typically granite, granodiorite
  * **Rhyolite**: continental crust
	  * thick, sticky lava: silica traps more gasses
	  * eruptions are extremely volatile
* **Intermediate**:
	* lava between runny and explosive
* **Mafic**: ocean crust, mid-ocean ridges
	* creates runny lava (think: maple syrup): lower silica content
	* **Basalt**:
		* **pahoehoe**: flows easily, re-entry into old lava tube
		* **aa**: "ah-ah", blocky texture

Characteristics:

* Attribute: Low —> High
* Fe, Mg: Felsic —> Ultramafic
* Density: Felsic —> Ultramafic
* Si, O: Ultramafic —> Felsic
* Temperature of formation: Felsic (700C) —> Ultramafic (1200C)

**Ash**: a grain size

**Pyroclastics**: older, crushed ash rocks (are they mafic or felsic?)

**Mantle Plume**:

Shild vs composite volcanoes

### Textures

Texture determines in/extrusive

**Phenocryst**: 

Types:

* **Phaneritic**: intrusive
  * **Porphyritic**:
* **Aphanitic**: too small to see, extrusive

####Fractional crystalization

Silica-rich: partially melt

1. Olivene (52% silica): pulls metals out of magma
2. (52%)
3. Hornblend

## Earthquakes

* Crust usually breaks in 3 cracks of ~$\frac{3\pi}{4}$

**Epicentre**:

**Focus**:

### Types of Waves

* Body:
	* P: faster
	* S
* Surface:
	* love
	* rally​

### Measuring

* 3/+ seismographs minimum
* Measure time between P and S waves
* In reality, all seismographs are useful
* **Strain energy**: built up tension on plates
* Scales:
  * **Richter magnitude scale**: logarithmic based on max amplitudes on seismographs
  * **Moment magnitude**: more accurate, related to fault rupture size and seismic energy
  * **Mercalli Intensity Scale**: *destructiveness* in proximity to population, infrastructure, time, rock types
  * Depth:

### Minimizing

* In California, if a building isn't up to code, you must have a sign up that says the building isn't up to code
* **Liquefaction**: when sediments / soil temporarily acts like liquid because the particles break contacts with each other
* Control dams

### Tsunamis

* If *strain energy* builds up, when the subduction plate breaks, the top plate jumps up a bit
* Travel fastest in deep water
* Slows down as the friction of the waves hit the ground
* **Turbidite**: underwater landslides
	* unsort sediments
* Can be caused by *turbidites*
* Requires more vertical than horizontal motion
* The amount of debris will increase momentum of wave
* You can know it's coming because it pulls away quickly at the shore

##Sedimentary Rocks

* 7% volume of crust, 75% surface coverage
* Signs of oil, coal, natural gas, etc., water

**fissile**: has fine layers

Types:

* **Biochemical** : Carbonate rocks: found primarily in ocean
	* **Limestone**: calcite
	* **Dolostone**: dolomite $(CaMg)_2 (CO_3)_2$
		* Fizzes when scraping with nail
* **Clastic**: made up of older rocks
	* Identification
		* (CU): Coarse
		* (M): Medium
	* **Conglomerate**: smooth
	* **Shale**: fissile, breaks into fine layers
	* **Siltstone**: glistening in sunlight, more gritty
* **Chemical**: usually similar to the other two, but was altered

###Characteristics

* **Angularity**: angular --> rounded, rough --> smooth
	* more transportation --> smoother
* **Sorting**: consistency of grain sizes
	* more transportation --> more sorted
	* brittleness unrelated
* **Chert**: biochemical & chemical
	* can be from silica shells of fossils
* **Ripples**:

	Can sand act where water is currently being used?

###Lithification

**Lithification**: conversion from sediments to rock

* requires heat
* heat comes from poor heat distribution
* **Compaction**: reduction in volume
* **Cementation**: precipitates bind the grains of sediment together
