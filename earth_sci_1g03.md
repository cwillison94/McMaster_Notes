--------------------

**Catastrophism**: catastrophes like Noah's ark change the earth

**Hutton's Revolution**:

**Uniformitarianism**: studying the present to explain the past

## Plate Tectonics

**Continental Drift**:

**Paleomagnetic Evidence**: when magnetite freezes, it is aligned with the particles of the north pole. We know that the rocks were moving because the direction of the north pole as we dig deeper shows it changing.

**Magnetic Reversal**: Earth goes through sudden shifts in polarity of North Pole and south pole. Alignments of rocks are symmetric on American side of mid-ocean ridge in Atlantic Ocean with European side

Since north part of magnet points the northern magnetic pole, the northern magnetic pole actually has *southern* polarity

**Isochron Dating**: how old are minerals, relative using common lines

**Abyssal plain**: flat oceanic area without ridges

**Seafloor Spreading**:

**Subduction**: when a plate goes under another, brings water down with it, and the boiling water melts the rocks above it as it goes down

**Magnetometer**: devices that measures for stronger or weeker local magnetic field

Rates of motion

**Wilson Cycles**:

## Mineral Classification

###Characteristics

How to differentiate?

1. Colour
2. Streak
3. **Lustre**: crystal light reflection
4. Hardness
5. **Crystal Habit**: directions and stuff of crystal growth
6. **Cleavage Planes**: ability to break along certain directions
	1. Differentiate from *crystal habit* because *cleavage planes* are repeated
7. **Fracture**: breaking without cleavage constraint
	1. **Irregular**: shattered, crumbly
	2. **Conchoidal**: flat, clean
		1. e.g. quartz
8. **Magnetism**:

####Colour

* Black: Fe, Mg
* Light: Felsic

####Lustre

* **Metallic**: think chrome
* **Vitreous / glassy**: glazed (e.g. quartz, feldspar, amphiboles)
* **Earthy**: think pottery, dull, clay
* **Silky**: (e.g. gypsum)
* **Pearly**: um...like a pearl?

####Hardness

Moh's Hardness scale

1. Talc
2. Gypsum (fingernail ~2.5)
3. Calcite (Copper wire ~3.5)
4. Fluorite
5. Apatite (Masonry nail ~5.5)
6. Orthoclase (streak plate 6-6.5)
7. Quartz
8. Topaz
9. Corundum
10. Diamond

####Habit

**Anhedral**: Inhibited growth; irregular shape

**Euhedral**: Uninhibited growth; mineral grows in preferred crystal shape; necessary if you want to be able to identify it

There's a chart of shapes, like blocky, hexagonal pyramid, etc.

### Intrusive

**Intrusive**: magma that doesn't make it to the surface, a.k.a. **plutonic**

* **Dikes**: cuts across old rock layers
* **Sill**: pushes between 2 rock layers

![Sill vs dike](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/The_difference_between_a_sill_and_a_dike.jpg)

### Igneous

**Extrusive**: cools outside

* crystals form quickly
* crystals are too small to see, i.e. *aphanitic*
* If multiple lava types, scattered *phenocrysts* in *porphyritic* rocks
* If gassy, becomes *frothy*
* If extremely fast, no crystals form at all, i.e. *glassy*

![component](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Mineralogy_igneous_rocks_EN.svg/2000px-Mineralogy_igneous_rocks_EN.svg.png)

| Composition  | Extrusive           | Intrusive  |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ---------- |
| Felsic       | Rhyolite            | Granite    |
| Intermediate | Andesite            | Diorite    |
| Mafic        | Basalt              | Gabbro     |
| Ultramafic   | Komatiite (Picrite) | Peridotite |

* **Felsic**: rich in quartz, primarily on continents, typically granite, granodiorite
  * Rich: K, Na, Si, Al
  * Lighter-coloured
  * **Rhyolite**: continental crust
	  * quartz
  * thick, sticky lava, i.e. more viscous
    * silica traps more gasses
  * eruptions are extremely volatile because of Silica
* **Intermediate**:
  * lava between runny and explosive
* **Mafic**: ocean crust, mid-ocean ridges, hotspots
	* creates runny lava (think: maple syrup): lower silica content
	* Rich: Mg, Fe, Ca
	* Poor: K, Na, Si
	* **Basalt**:
		* **Flood basalts**: flat terrain causes columnar joints so looks cubic
		* **pahoehoe**: flows easily, re-entry into old lava tube

	* Mafic
	* large, but shallow
* **Composite volcanoes**:
	* Felsic
	* small, but steep

### Textures

Texture determines in/extrusive

* **Aphanitic**: too small to see, extrusive
* **Porphyritic**: mix of 2 distinct sizes of the same/different minerals
* **Glassy**: no crystals, e.g. obsidian
* **Frothy**: contains vesicles / gas bubbles
	* e.g. pumice
	* a.k.a. **cellular**

####Fractional crystalization

Silica-rich: partially melt

1. Olivene (52% silica): pulls metals out of magma
2. (52%)
3. Hornblend
4. Biotite: requires Fe, mica

## Earthquakes

* Crust usually breaks in 3 cracks of ~$\frac{3\pi}{4}$

**Epicentre**:

**Focus**:

### Types of Waves

* Body:
  * P: faster
  * **Shear (S)**:
    * don't go through 
    * liquids
* Surface:
  * love
  * rally​

### Measuring

* 3/+ seismographs minimum
* Measure time between P and S waves
* In reality, all seismographs are useful
* **Strain energy**: built up tension on plates
* Scales:
  * **Richter magnitude scale**: logarithmic based on max amplitudes on seismographs
  * **Moment magnitude**: more accurate, related to fault rupture size and seismic energy
  * **Mercalli Intensity Scale**: *destructiveness* in proximity to population, infrastructure, time, rock types
  * Depth:

### Minimizing

* In California, if a building isn't up to code, you must have a sign up that says the building isn't up to code
* **Liquefaction**: when sediments / soil temporarily acts like liquid because the particles break contacts with each other
* Control dams

### Tsunamis

* If *strain energy* builds up, when the subduction plate breaks, the top plate jumps up a bit
* Travel fastest in deep water
* Slows down as the friction of the waves hit the ground
* **Turbidite**: underwater landslides
  * unsort sediments
* Can be caused by *turbidites*
* Requires more vertical than horizontal motion
* The amount of debris will increase momentum of wave
* You can know it's coming because it pulls away quickly at the shore

##Sedimentary Rocks

* 7% volume of crust, 75% surface coverage
* Signs of oil, coal, natural gas, etc., water

**fissile**: has fine layers

**Stratum**: (plural: **strata**) layers of sedimentary rock or sediments with distinct, consistent characteristics

**Clast**: fragments of mineral grains

###Characteristics

* **Angularity**: angular --> rounded, rough --> smooth
	* more transportation --> smoother
* **Sphericity**: how closely *clast* represents sphere
* **Sorting**: consistency of grain sizes
	* more transportation --> more sorted
	* brittleness unrelated
	* Glaciers highly unsorted
* **Grain Size**:
	* deposition location is dependent on water energy
	* high energy --> course
	* low energy --> fine
	* Sizes:
		* Gravel
		* Sand
		* Silt
		* Clay
* **Packing**: arrangement of clasts
	* **Framework-supported**: large clasts in contact with each other and smaller clasts in the holes
	* **Matrix-supported**: large clasts not necessarily touching
* **Vugs**: small to medium-sized cavities inside rock
	* can be caused by reduction in volume after chemical reaction

###Types

	* Identification
	* (CU): Coarse
	* (M): Medium
	* Examples:
		* Rock fragments:
			* **Conglomerate**: rounded
			* **Breccia**: angular
		* **Sandstone**: quartz, feldspar sand
		* Mudstone: silty
			* **Siltstone**: glistening in sunlight, more gritty
			* **Shale**: fissile, breaks into fine layers (~3/4 of sedimentary rocks), mainly clay
* **Chemical**: usually similar to the other two, but was altered
	* formed from precipitate in solution
	* **Limestone**: calcite
	* Fizzes when powder + HCl
	* Examples:
		* **Dolostone**: dolomite $(CaMg)_2 (CO_3)_2$
		* **Chert**: biochemical & chemical
			* can be from silica shells of fossils
			* forms when water washes through rock, leaving behind minerals, like Si
			* extremely hard
			* conchoidal fracture
* **Biochemical**: chemical with fossil
	* found primarily in ocean
	* Examples:
		* **Coquina**: poorly cemented shells
		* **Chalk**: fine, soft microfossils
		* **Fossiliferous Limestone**: well-cemented visible fossil shells

###Lithification

**Lithification**: conversion from sediments to rock

* requires heat
* heat comes from poor heat distribution
* **Compaction**: reduction in volume
* **Cementation**: precipitates bind the grains of sediment together
* Mostly formed in water
* Also forms from:
	* **Aeolian**: wind
	* Glacial
		* poorly sorted sediments

##Metamorphic Rocks

Formed with:

* Heat: not enough to melt
	* **Contact**: formed with heat by touching magma in magma chambers
		* Close to surface, so low pressure
* Pressure
	* **Regional**: pressure from tectonic plates
		* usually foliated
		* deep underground
	* Glaciers cannot form metamorphic rocks
		* lack of heat
		* Not as much pressure as a continental collision
* Fluids

**Protolith**: the solid rocks that form a metamorphic rock

**Pressure-Temperature (P-T) Diagram**: although pressure is on y-axis, negative to match depth of Earth

###Foliated rocks

**Foliation**: compression that causes platy elongation from dragging, shearing, etc., i.e. look for long streaks

* planar texture
* Forces, stress perpendicular to stretch
* Different magnitudes of stress for each axis

####Types

Different metamorphism stages:

1. Slaty: microscopic, extremely fine
	* Slate: shiny, hard, crystals ring when hit
	* Precursor: shale
2. Phyllitic: fine
	* Phyllite:
	* wavy
3. Schistose: medium
	* parallel foliation
	* Schist: variable composition
4. Gneissic: course
	* alternating layers of parallel foliation because so much pressure
	* Gneiss:
	* Migmatite: gneiss + granite
5. Melting

###Non-foliated

> **Non-foliated**: No preferential grain alignment due to uniform stress

* Named after mineral composition

####Examples

* Quartzite: quartz sandstone
	* cleavage not along boundaries between different rocks
* Ampibolite: basalt, gabbro 
* Meta-conglomerate: conglomerate
* Marble: limestone, dolostone

##Stress

Determined by:

* temperature
* pressure

###Forces

* **Compressive**: folding
* **Tensional**: stretching
* **Shear**: two things going in different directions

**Brittle Response**: creates fractures called **joints**

###Ductile

**Ductile**: stays one piece, but changes shape

* more common when hotter temperatures

###Shifts

**Footwall**: rock below fault

**Hanging wall**: rock above fault

![Dip Angle](http://eqseis.geosc.psu.edu/~cammon/HTML/Classes/IntroQuakes/Notes/Images_specific/dip_def.gif)

Types:

* **Normal**:
  * dip angle > pi/4
  * hanging wall goes down relative to footwall
* **Reverse**:
  * dip angle > pi/4
  * hanging wall goes up relative to footwall
  * compression
* **Thrust**:
  * dip angle is < pi/4
  * up
  * e.g. Rockies
* **Strike-Slip**: horizontal movement for vertical faults
  * **Left-lateral**: if the fault in front moved to the left relative to the back one
  * San Andreas is *right-lateral*

####Folds

> result of ductile/plastic response

2 limbs divided by **axial plane**

	Think: bendy fault 

* **Anticline**: rolls up, then down, like a wave
  * **Dome**: 2D anticline
* **Syncline**: rolls down, then up, like a bowl
  * **Basin**: 2D syncline
  * **Basement**: bottom of basin
  * e.g. Michigan basin / escarpment

##Age

* **Relative**: age relative to other objects / events
  * Generally doesn't change as detection technology changes
* **Absolute**: age in years

**Cross-Cutting**: feature that cuts across another older feature

1. A (Alluvium)
2. J (Basalt Dike)
3. B (Arkose)
4. C (Conglomerate)
5. I (Stock)
6. D (Sandstone)
7. E (Shale)
8. F (Limestone)
9. G (Siltstone) ?
10. H (Dolomite)  ?

###Ranges

| Range |      Era    | Epoch        |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 65.5M | Cenozoic    | Anthropocene |
| 251M  | Mesozoic    | Holocene     |
| 542M  | Paleozoic   |              |
| 4.6B  | Precambrian |              |

###Techniques

Usually you use many dating methods on the same sample

**Stratigraphic Correlation**: if a fossil is found above another in one region, you'll know the relative age and that if you find it in another region, it will still have the same relative age

**Index Fossil**: existed for short time interval, but wide geographic distribution	

**Faunal Succession**: 

###Unconformity

> gap in sedimentary record

* **Disconformities**: parallel sediment above and below erosion
* **Angular Unconformity**:
* **Nonconformity**: metamorphic rock under sedimentary

####Radioactive Dating

> using half life to determine proportion of remaining amount of a radioactive isotope (**parent**) to the isotope it decomposes to (**daughter**)

Recall types of radioactive decay:

* Alpha Decay: He^+^
* Beta Decay: N = P + e-
* Electron Capture: P + e- = N
* Gamma Decay:

Assumptions:

* No daughter initially
* Nothing escaped

Difficulties:

* pretty difficult after 10^th^ half-life
* detecting daughter if half-life too big

**Radiocarbon Dating**:^14^C —> ^14^N (5730 year)

Plants take in ^14^C during photosynthesis

**Bracketing**: radiometric dating + cross-cutting

##Resources

**Geologic Resource**: something that came from the lithosphere (not water!)

##Fossil Fuels

**Reserve**: where there's oil that isn't worth getting

###Formation

**Peat**: dead, decaying plant matter

**Coal**: peat + heat

* If you don't get bacteria decomposing dead organisms, you get **oil**
* Oxygen-poor water
* Marine organisms
* **Tar-sands**: organisms have started to get at the oil
* Additional heat forms **natural gas**
* Additional heat leaves you with pure carbon, usually in the form of graphite
* limited to certain depth ranges

###Locating

**Permeability**: how connected rock pores are
* We can determine what is under the ground by how waves bounce underground when we bang it
* Since it is buoyant, rises
* Gets trapped under impermeable layers (**seal rock**) in porous rocks (**reservoir rock**)
  * If no *seal rock*, it rises up to the surface and usually catches fire and doesn't stop burning for years

**Porosity**: percentage of rock's volume that is openings

###Coal Mining

**Strip mining**:

* Process:
  * blowing up a chunk of land then moving it over
  * removing the coal
  * replanting the previous stuff
* Increases sulphur content, making water more acidic
  * Acid dissolves heavy metals

###Nuclear

* You need to be careful about getting rid of the radioactive waste

##Maps

###Cross-Section

> A graph or 2D slice of a topological map to identify elevation changes across a line

To draw *cross-sections*:

1. Method 1: easier, but impossible to change horizontal scale
   1. Take a piece of paper, and line it up with the line
   2. Make notches at every elevation change
2. Method 2:
   1. Take a ruler and measure the distance between each change and the beginning of the line
   2. Multiply this distance by the scale and put that on your graph

Note:

* Rivers are assumed to be very shallow;  just put a little bump
* Label the following things:
  * River valleys
  * Hilltops
  * Relief: height between river and hill

###Contour

* Contour lines can never cross, except where an overhanging slope exists
* Contours equal elevation
* Rivers are identified by v's or dots

![Rivers](http://www.schools.ccps.k12.va.us/sites/HIGH/solquiz/Document%20Library/1/EOC2007EarthScience/18.jpg)

###UTM

**Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system (UTM)**:

* six digits: `EEENNN`
  * first three digits being the 'Easting'
  * line immediately west of feature in question
  * last three digits the 'Northing'
  * line immediately south of feature in question

###Map Elements

####Magnetic Decline

> Current angle between True North and Magnetic North

* Fraction of degree represented by 60 **minutes**, represented by 60 **seconds**
* **True North (TN)**: physical, non-moving pole  
* **Grid North (GN)**: direction of North pole in year of mapping
* **Magnetic North (MN)**: direction of magnetic North pole
  * MN~today = MN~print + GN + rate*(year~today - year~mapping)
  * Keep in mind if GN is in opposite direction of TN, its negative
  * Sometimes on map represented by angle between GN and MN, instead of TN and MN

####Scales

**Vertical Exaggeration (VE)**: it's like slope but for the scale

* vertical scale/horizontal scale
* the scales need to be in fraction form first, i.e. 1cm/whatever

**Gradient**: actual slope, i.e. rise/run = d~vertical/d~horizontal

**Verbal Scale**: relationship between distance on map vs real life

###Planes

> place when two rock layers meet

* **Strike**: line across a plane at a constant elevation
	* **Strike angle**angle from North to the *strike* line
	* take all points at a given elevation at rock contacts
	* connect points with line
	* label with elevation, contact name
* **Dip**: line that goes directly along the slope without deviation
	* **Dip angle**: downwards angle compared to a straight plane
* Defined by 3 points in space
* From a given vantage point, the apparent distance between heights determines the angle
* Assumption:
	* North is 0deg
	* East is $\frac{\pi}{2}$
	* South is $\pi$
	* West is $\frac{3\pi}{2}$
* `Strike / dip direction`
	* `_ _ _ / _ _  _ _`
	* `315deg / 15deg NW`

###Cross Section

You need to draw the dip angle at each divide between two rock types. This is how:

1. make two lines along the fault perpendicular to the line
2. find the height at the points where the lines meet your cross section area
3. d = distance between two points
4. h = height difference between two points
5. tan(dip angle) = h/d
6. Draw a line from the division point down to the bottom with the calculated dip angle.

##Mining

**Metallic ores**: primarily *sulphides*, **NOT** *silicates*

* concentrated near hydrothermic fluids
* e.g. black smoker vents

**Ore veins**:

**Placer Deposits**: looking for deposits in streams is just the remains from the original ore veins that have sometimes been completely eroded into the sediments of the stream

Acid mining, acid rain from smelting

##Streams

**Dissolved Load**: dissolved ions (usually 35% concentration of suspended load)

**Salinity**: saltiness, measured in units of Parts Per Million (PPM)

**Total Dissolved Solvents (TDS)**: measured in units of Parts Per Mission (PPM)

**Suspended Load**: suspended particles

**Bed Load**: particles dragged along bottom of stream

**Capacity**​: how much stream can carry

* speed:
  * larger particles
  * more stuff overall
  * i.e. when dams slow down streams, they dump sediment

**Long Profile**: cross section along channel highlighting changing gradients from source to mouth

**Base level**: limiting level below which stream can not erode, usually a non-moving water body

Pure water picks up more sediments since less saturated

Types of drainage patterns:

* **Dendritic**: flat
* **Trellis**: a series of synclines, where each fold has its own tributaries
* **Rectangular**: caused by faults
* **Radial**: central elevated point, such as volcano
* **Parallel**: synclines parallel to river

**Conductivity**: measured in siemens (s)

**Discharge** [Q]: the amount of water a stream is outputting at a given point

* measured in (m^3 / s)
* Q = Cross-sectional-Area * velocity
* Different parts of a stream can have different amounts of discharge, so be weary to find the velocity in 3 parts of a stream

**Cutting Bank**: faster, outside part of a stream where sediments are generally deposited

**Door-side**: right

**Window-side**: left

###Spreading

**Delta**:

* hitting flat base level
* dumps water into still water body at the end, i.e. lake, ocean, etc.
* so sediment is distributed

**Alluvial Fan**:

* same shape as delta
* lots of sediment
* hitting lower gradient, not necessarily flat
* dumps into valley, NOT water body

**Braided Stream**: channels constantly moving because of sediments, commonly found near glaciers

**Meandering Stream**: 

**Cutbank**: 

**Point bars**: 

**Point Bar**: when sediment is deposited around the inside of a curve

* can build up to form natural levees

**Floodplain**: 

###Flow

Important thing is average velocity, not each incremental velocity

##Groundwater

**Springs**: discharge of groundwater

* **Effluent**: streams fed by surrounding groundwater
	* i.e. gaining water
* **Influent**: streams above the water table
  * arid regions
  * i.e. losing water

**Recharge area**: areas where water table is gaining water

**Discharge area**: areas where water table is losing water

**Cone of depression**: 

**Aquifers**: permeable sediment where groundwater pools

**Aquitard**: fine-grained sediments / rock with low permability, such as clay, preventing flow of contaminants into groundwater

###Pollution

* pollution is best placed on aquitards
* some of it floats / sinks
* salt meets fresh leads to sulfate smells (it's safe, though)
* Ph/N/K: algal blooms

####Phosphorus

1. Algal bloom
2. fungi, bacteria eat up algae, requiring oxygen
3. Oxygen in water decreases, suffocating fish

###Overmining

* Pore space collapses
  * causes ground to lower
  * more flood-prone because pores have collapsed
* Water table can form **caves** or **karst** when water table disappears and only limestone remains
  * **stalactite**: top
  * **stalagmite**: bottom
  * creates **sinkhole** when collapses

##Landslides

###Types

**Creep**: mass wasting

**Frost Wedging**: 

**Rock Falls**: angle too high

**Rock slide**: bedrock loses cohesion with rock below it

###Major incidents

* *Gros Ventre*:
  * Weak layers, such as shale, supporting heavy loads
  * groundwater high from lots of rain
  * erosion
* *Vaiont Dam*:
  * dams raise water table
  * this caused mountain to collapse into reservoir
  * water overflowed the dam
  * water washed away city
  * prevented by **rock bolts** between top shale layer and bedrock
* *Frank Slide*: Alberta
  * thrust fault, anticline
  * since mine didn't collapse, mining was not cause of slide
  * people survived, got out thru ventilation shaft
  * could have been dynamite or an earthquake
* *Rissa Landslide*: Norway
	* when collapses into water, creates splash and disturbs surrounding land
	* fresh water lake reduces salt concentration
	* no basement, low rise, mostly fields, blast sediment

###Hazards

* shallow roots from no trees
* heavy buildings
* meandering streams against foot of slope
* sprinklers raise water table
* rocky soil
* plateau roads create artificial cliffs, I.e. steeper slopes
* Lighter layers movement supporting heavier layers

**Leda clay**:

* from ancient marine sediments
* quick clay has higher water content and usually has regular clay underneath it
* salt concentration < 1g/L makes a liquid
* (a.k.a. **quick clay**)

**Angle of Repose**: angle of free moving material before collapsing at gravitational equilibrium

* particle size
* sorting
* angularity

###Minimizing effects

* think about *sea-to-sky highway* in Vancouver
* nets
* when you see a slide, it will probably happen again, so be cautious

##Oceans

Tourist attractions:

* reefs
* oil

Without continents, water would follow wind systems, i.e. opposite of Earth's rotation

Surface current vs deep water current

Deep water:

* cold
  * i.e. more oxygen rich
  * i.e. nutrient rich
  * around poles

##Glaciers

> Snow that makes it through the winter

Significance:

* Glacial Deposits
  * Groundwater goes through it
  * Water colour is cool because of light wavelength
* Glacial Erosion
  * **Cirque**: bowl-like valleys carved out
  * **Arête**: ridge between cirques where ice sheets meet
  * If there's an uneven surface like a bump, the glacier will crack it and break it down over time
  * U-Shaped valley, NOT V-shaped valley (i.e. rivers/streams)
  * **Hanging Valleys**:
  * Waterfalls

###History

* Analyze pollen because it lasts longer
* Old borders due to water trapped in ice on land
* Snow --> ice is like sediment --> ice, i.e. both require *compression*
* black dots on microscope represents air bubbles that form between crystals as ice formed

###Formation

* **Accumulation**: highest point
* **Ablation**: melting, generally directly into ocean
* **Toe**: in equilibrium, will never touch that point
* *Equilibrium*: accumulation = ablation
* *Advance*: if accumulation > ablation
* *Retreat*: if accumulation < ablation
* Snow is darker when it starts melting
  * Darker snow is affected by **Albedo effect**, i.e. reflection of light and melts *even faster*

###Movement

* fastest in the middle
* **Wet glacier**: meltwater at bottom makes it flow really fast

##Global Change
