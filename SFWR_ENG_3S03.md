Challenges of Software Testing
-----------------------------------

* Budget pressure
 * Project planner underestimates costs of a stage
 * Estimated budget was never approved
 * Safety is required before features 
* Time pressure
 * Lower time pressure with more developers
 * Can happen if there are too many delaying factors
* Managing testing
 * Those who do testing need to be qualified
 * How to test?
     * What?
     * When?
     * How much resources?
 * Ambiguous Requirements, documentation, etc.
 * More environments
 * More languages
 * More layers

Measurement
-----------------------------------

**Metric**: a quantitative attribute 

**Measurement**:

**Benchmark**: a standard unit of measurement 

**Measure**: to determine the measurements of something

**Symbol**: a short representation of a unit of measurement

###What to measure?

Measure everything useful to achieving your goals.

Sometimes, it can be difficult to describe an attribute using a metric, e.g. colour in nanometres.

Sometimes you want to measure something that is a combination of attributes.

###Types of measurements

**Deductive**: directly measured 

**Inductive**: determined by putting different deduced information together

Models for testing
-----------------------------------

Often, it's not enough to simply say whether something is good or bad, so we define a model that scores it using a combination of metrics that give a quantitative score. That includes:

* Quality of Requirements
* Management issues
* Quality of work
* Productivity
* Cost
 * **Effort**: 
 * **Size**: lines of codes & function points
 * **Productivity**: 
* etc.

product: physical entity, e.g. 
process: observable at run-time, e.g. complexity
resource: hr stuff, manpower, e.g. productivity

Models demonstrate:

1. Things whose effects are neglected
2. Things that affect that model that you didn't consider.
3. Things that you did consider

**Gib's Fuzzy Testing**: 

<ins>Khedri's words of wisdom</ins>: when the company at your internship is doing stuff in a non-systematic way, do what you can to change it.

**COnstructive COst MOdel (COCOMO)**:

------------------

```sequence
A->B: h^{nf}
A->B: h
```

$A=(A,F,R)$

$h^{m_R}$ is a subset of P

`(S,F,R)`

A structure is **algebraic** iff $R=0$
`(S,F)`

A structure is **relational** iff $F=0$
`(S,R)`

####e.g. Graphs

$$G = (V,E)
=( \{a,b,c,d\},\{a,d\},\{b,c\},\{a,b\},\{d,c\},)$$

A = V
F = 0
$R = \{E\}$

$h \left ( f\left ( a_1,...,a_{n_y} \right ) \right ) = g \left (h^{n_f} \left ( a_1,..., a_{n_y} \right ) \right )$

####Surjective
: *Nothing goes unmapped*
> * Not [injective](#injective)
> * Could be a <ins>measurement mapping</ins>

![moo](images/surjection.png)

####Injective
: *No overlap*
> Not [surjective](#surjective)

![moo](images/injection.png)

####Bijection
: *A function + injective + surjective*
> Every definition is reached once

![moo](images/bijection.png)

###Evaluating software

####Likert Scale
: A reliability scale of software where someone selects agreement from a set of {`strongly agree`, `agree`, `neither`, `disagree`, `strongly disagree`}

####Forced Ranking
: Rank the options from 1 (best) to *n* (worst).

####Verbal Frequency
: Select failure frequency from the set of {`Always`, `Often`, `Sometimes`, `Seldom`, `Never`}.

####Comparative Scale
: Pick integer from 1---*n* from `Superior` to `Inferior`

####Numerical Scale
: Pick integer from 1---*n* from `Unimportant` to `Important`

####Statement Type
: blah

###More...

####Homomorphism
: A **homomorphism** or **representation** is a mapping from $A$ to $B$ that preserves the operations of $A$ to the corresponding in $B$. It also weakly preserves the relations in $A$ to their corresponding in $B$.
> i.e. a structure from $A$ to $B$ that satisfies rule 2 (function) and 3 (relation).
> $$h: A  \rightarrow  B$$

: An application of this concept is described in a book called [*Calculus is Algebra* by William Hatcher](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/2321645.pdf?acceptTC=true).

The connection between the real $(S, F, R)$ and mathematical worlds $\mathbb{R}_R, F_R, R_R$, using empirical analysis, $\mu_1$.


####McCabe Threshold

$\eta$ measures:

* fault-prone
* maintainability
* Range: 0-10

####Direct Measurement
> ga

####Reliability Model

$$F(t) = 1 - e^{-\left (N - i + 1 \right )at}$$

###Measurement Scales

Scale = (, mapping)

**Algebraic Difference Structure**: 

**Admissible transformation**: allows you to move from scale-to-scale when the attributes and scale are the same

* integral scale: $g(x) = \alpha\mu(x) + p$
* Ratio scale: $g(x) = \alpha\mu(x)$
* ordinal scale: strictly monotonic scale
* nominal: one-to-one mapping

**Halstead**: 

##Concatenating Scales

####Nominal
* <ins>no order</ins>
* pick from set of categorized responses
* e.g. gender, colour, religion, etc.

####Ordinal
* <ins>ordered</ins>
* non-linear scale
* Arbitrary distance between values
* e.g. satisfaction from 1-4
	* Difference between 1-2 â‰  diff 3-4

####Interval
* ordered
* <ins>linear scale</ins>
* arbitrary zero value

####Ratio
* ordered
* linear scale
* <ins>zero identifies absence</ins>

####Absolute
* ordered
* linear scale
* zero identifies absence
* <ins>cannot be negative</ins>

##Empirical Scale
: *derived through experimentation and observation, not theory*

Analyzing the difference between reality and mathematical scales

1. Define your empirical relation. It could be any symbol you want. `>>`, `+`, `o`, etc.

$sc = $ 

##Other Stuff again

**Quotient Structure**: MyHill-

MCC**:

**BSEQ**:

**BALT**:

**RSEQ**: $\text(RSEQ)(R_1, R_2) = $

$\mu (x) = \frac{1}{\mu'(x)}$

Writing a Testing Plan
-----------------------------------

* Make sure you don't use illegal software
* If it's free, there's probably a license associated with it, so read that license.
* Implied warranty
* Be specific of inputs

**Meaningful transformation**:  

###Parts

1. **Specifications**: correct input and output, i.e. pre- & post-conditions
2. **Methods & Constraints**: 
3. **Methodology**: 
4. **Test tools**
5. **Extent**: how much of the code and why
6. **Data Recording**: 
7. **Constraints**: 
8. **Evaluation**: 

###Project Management

* Unit description
* Milestones (a.k.a. dates)
* Budget
* Test approach
* Functions not tested
* Test constraints

###Principles

* *Developers should avoid testing their own programs (still debug, tho)*: dev's perspective is different from users' perspective
* *Organizations should avoid testing their own programs*: people have stresses like time that makes people within an organization accept certain mistakes

Testing
: Finding the errors in a program, **NOT** proving its correctness

Fault Seeding
: Predicting where your program will fail
