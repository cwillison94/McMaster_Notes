--------------------

**Catastrophism**: catastrophes like Noah's ark change the earth

**Hutton's Revolution**:

**Uniformitarianism**: studying the present to explain the past

## Plate Tectonics

**Continental Drift**:

**Paleomagnetic Evidence**: when magnetite freezes, it is aligned with the particles of the north pole. We know that the rocks were moving because the direction of the north pole as we dig deeper shows it changing.

**Magnetic Reversal**: Earth goes through sudden shifts in polarity of North Pole and south pole. Alignments of rocks are symmetric on American side of mid-ocean ridge in Atlantic Ocean with European side

Since north part of magnet points the northern magnetic pole, the northern magnetic pole actually has *southern* polarity

**Isochron Dating**: how old are minerals

**Abyssal plain**: flat oceanic area without ridges

**Seafloor Spreading**:

**Subduction**: when a plate goes under another, brings water down with it, and the boiling water melts the rocks above it as it goes down

**Magnetometer**: devices that measures for stronger or weeker local magnetic field

## Mineral Classification

###Characteristics

How to differentiate?

1. Colour
2. Streak
3. **Lustre**: crystal light reflection
4. Hardness
5. **Crystal Habit**: directions and stuff of crystal growth
6. **Cleavage**: ability to break along certain directions / planes

More:

* **Magnetism**:

####Colour

* **Black**: Fe, Mg
* Light: Felsic

####Lustre

* **Metallic**: think chrome
* **Vitreous / glassy**: glazed (e.g. quartz, feldspar, amphiboles)
* **Earthy**: think pottery, dull, clay
* **Silky**: (e.g. gypsum)
* **Pearly**: um...like a pearl?

####Hardness

Moh's Hardness scale

1. Talc
2. Gypsum (fingernail ~2.5)
3. Calcite (Copper wire ~3.5)
4. Fluorite
5. Apatite (Masonry nail ~5.5)
6. Orthoclase (streak plate 6-6.5)
7. Quartz

####Habit

**Anhedral**: Inhibited growth; irregular shape

**Euhedral**: Uninhibited growth; mineral grows in preferred crystal shape; necessary if you want to be able to identify it

There's a chart of shapes, like blocky, hexagonal pyramid, etc.

### Intrusive

**Intrusive**: magma that doesn't make it to the surface

**Dikes** can form between **sill**, older rocks.

### Igneous

| Composition  | Extrusive           | Intrusive  |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ---------- |
| Felsic       | Rhyolite            | Granite    |
| Intermediate | Andesite            | Diorite    |
| Mafic        | Basalt              | Gabbro     |
| Ultramafic   | Komatiite (Picrite) | Peridotite |

* **Felsic**: rich in quartz, primarily on continents, typically granite, granodiorite
  * Rich: K, Na, Si, Al
  * Lighter-coloured
  * **Rhyolite**: continental crust
  * thick, sticky lava: silica traps more gasses
  * eruptions are extremely volatile
* **Intermediate**:
  * lava between runny and explosive
* **Mafic**: ocean crust, mid-ocean ridges
  * creates runny lava (think: maple syrup): lower silica content
  * Rich: Mg, Fe, Ca
  * Poor: K, Na, Si
  * **Basalt**:
  * **pahoehoe**: flows easily, re-entry into old lava tube
  * **aa**: "ah-ah", blocky texture

Characteristics:

* Attribute: Low —> High
* Fe, Mg: Felsic —> Ultramafic
* Density: Felsic —> Ultramafic
* Si, O: Ultramafic —> Felsic
* Temperature of formation: Felsic (700C) —> Ultramafic (1200C)

**Ash**: a grain size

**Pyroclastics**: older, crushed ash rocks (are they mafic or felsic?)

**Mantle Plume**:

Shild vs composite volcanoes

### Textures

Texture determines in/extrusive

**Phenocryst**: 

Types:

* **Phaneritic**: intrusive
* **Aphanitic**: too small to see, extrusive
* **Porphyritic**: mix of 2 distinct sizes

####Fractional crystalization

Silica-rich: partially melt

1. Olivene (52% silica): pulls metals out of magma
2. (52%)
3. Hornblend

## Earthquakes

* Crust usually breaks in 3 cracks of ~$\frac{3\pi}{4}$

**Epicentre**:

**Focus**:

### Types of Waves

* Body:
  * P: faster
  * S
* Surface:
  * love
  * rally​

### Measuring

* 3/+ seismographs minimum
* Measure time between P and S waves
* In reality, all seismographs are useful
* **Strain energy**: built up tension on plates
* Scales:
  * **Richter magnitude scale**: logarithmic based on max amplitudes on seismographs
  * **Moment magnitude**: more accurate, related to fault rupture size and seismic energy
  * **Mercalli Intensity Scale**: *destructiveness* in proximity to population, infrastructure, time, rock types
  * Depth:

### Minimizing

* In California, if a building isn't up to code, you must have a sign up that says the building isn't up to code
* **Liquefaction**: when sediments / soil temporarily acts like liquid because the particles break contacts with each other
* Control dams

### Tsunamis

* If *strain energy* builds up, when the subduction plate breaks, the top plate jumps up a bit
* Travel fastest in deep water
* Slows down as the friction of the waves hit the ground
* **Turbidite**: underwater landslides
  * unsort sediments
* Can be caused by *turbidites*
* Requires more vertical than horizontal motion
* The amount of debris will increase momentum of wave
* You can know it's coming because it pulls away quickly at the shore

##Sedimentary Rocks

* 7% volume of crust, 75% surface coverage
* Signs of oil, coal, natural gas, etc., water

**fissile**: has fine layers

Types:

* **Biochemical** : Carbonate rocks: found primarily in ocean
  * **Limestone**: calcite
  * **Dolostone**: dolomite $(CaMg)_2 (CO_3)_2$
  * Fizzes when scraping with nail
* **Clastic**: made up of older rocks
  * Identification
  * (CU): Coarse
  * (M): Medium
  * **Conglomerate**: smooth
  * **Shale**: fissile, breaks into fine layers (~3/4 of sedimentary rocks)
  * **Siltstone**: glistening in sunlight, more gritty
* **Chemical**: usually similar to the other two, but was altered

###Characteristics

* **Angularity**: angular --> rounded, rough --> smooth
  * more transportation --> smoother
* **Sorting**: consistency of grain sizes
  * more transportation --> more sorted
  * brittleness unrelated
* **Chert**: biochemical & chemical
  * can be from silica shells of fossils
* **Ripples**:

	Can sand act where water is currently being used?

###Lithification

**Lithification**: conversion from sediments to rock

* requires heat
* heat comes from poor heat distribution
* **Compaction**: reduction in volume
* **Cementation**: precipitates bind the grains of sediment together

##Metamorphic Rocks

Experienced heat, pressure, or fluids

**Protolith**: always change a solid rock, despite conditions

**P-T Diagram**: although pressure is on y-axis, negative to match depth of Earth

Low pressure, high temperature happens in magma chambers

	Can glaciers have low temp, high pressure?

Not as much pressure as a continental collision.

###Foliated rocks

**Foliation**: compression that causes platy elongation from dragging, shearing, etc.

Forces, stress perpendicular to stretch

###Examples

* Slate: shiny, hard, crystals ring when hit
* Schist: 
* Phylite: 
* Migmatite: 
* Biotite: requires Fe
* Gneiss:

###Non-foliated

Sources:

* Limestone:
  * e.g. Marble
* Sandstone:
  * e.g. Quartzite: cleavage not along boundaries between different rocks
* **Mafic**: Amphibolite

##Stress

Determined by:

* temperature

###Brittle

**Brittle**: breaks when stress applied

**Joint**: fractures where no movement

###Ductile

**Ductile**: stays one piece, but changes shape

* more common when hotter temperatures

**Footwall**: rock below fault

**Hanging wall**: rock above fault

###Shifts

Types:

* **Normal**: hanging wall goes down relative to footwall
* **Reverse**: hanging wall goes up relative to footwall
  * **Thrust**: angle is < pi/4
* **Strike-Slip**: horizontal movement for vertical faults
  * **Left-lateral**: if the fault in front moved to the left relative to the back one
  * San Andreas is *right-lateral*

###Forces

* **Compressive**:
* **Tensional**:

###Folds

2 limbs divided by **axial plane**

	Think: bendy fault 

* **Anticline**: rolls up, then down, like a wave
* **Syncline**: rolls down, then up, like a bowl

Folding in 2 directions

**Basin**

**Dome**

##Age

* **Relative**: age relative to other objects / events
  * Generally doesn't change as detection technology changes
* **Absolute**: age in years

**Cross-Cutting**: feature that cuts across another older feature

1. A (Alluvium)
2. J (Basalt Dike)
3. B (Arkose)
4. C (Conglomerate)
5. I (Stock)
6. D (Sandstone)
7. E (Shale)
8. F (Limestone)
9. G (Siltstone) ?
10. H (Dolomite)  ?

###Ranges

| Range | Era  | Epoch        |
| ----- | ---- | ------------ |
|       |      | Anthropocene |
|       |      | Holocene     |
|       |      |              |

###Techniques

Usually you use many dating methods on the same sample

**Stratigraphic Correlation**: if a fossil is found above another in one region, you'll know the relative age and that if you find it in another region, it will still have the same relative age

**Index Fossil**: existed for short time interval, but wide geographic distribution

**Faunal Succession**: 

**Unconformities**: gap in sedimentary record

* **Disconforities**: parallel sediment above and below erosion
* **Angular Unconformity**:
* **Nonconformity**: metamorphic rock under sedimentary

####Radioactive Dating

**Radioactive Dating**: using half life to determine proportion of remaining amount of a radioactive isotope (**parent**) to the isotope it decomposes to (**daughter**)

Recall types of radioactive decay:

* Alpha Decay: He^+^
* Beta Decay:
* Gamma Decay:

Assumptions:

* No daughter initially
* Nothing escaped

Difficulties:

* pretty difficult after 10^th^ half-life
* detecting daughter if half-life too big

**Radiocarbon Dating**:^14^C —> ^14^N

Plants take in ^14^C during photosynthesis

**Bracketing**:

###Ranges

| Years | Era  |      |
| ----- | ---- | ---- |
|       |      |      |
|       |      |      |
|       |      |      |

##Resources

**Geologic Resource**: something that came from the lithosphere (not water!)

###Fossil Fuels

**Reserve**: where there's oil that isn't worth getting

####Formation

* If you don't get bacteria decomposing dead organisms, you get oil
* Oxygen-poor water
* Marine organisms
* Tar-sands: organisms have started to get at the oil
* Additional heat forms natural gas
* Additional heat leaves you with pure carbon, usually in the form of graphite
* limited to certain depth ranges

####Locating

* We can determine what is under the ground by how waves bounce underground when we bang it
* Since it is buoyant, rises
* Gets trapped under impermeable layers (**seal rock**) in porous rocks (**reservoir rock**)
  * If no *seal rock*, it rises up to the surface and usually catches fire and doesn't stop burning for years

##Maps

* use millimetres

**Cross-section**: a graph or 2D slice of a topological map to identify elevation changes across a line

To draw *cross-sections*:

1. Method 1: easier, but impossible to change horizontal scale
   1. Take a piece of paper, and line it up with the line
   2. Make notches at every elevation change
2. Method 2:
   1. Take a ruler and measure the distance between each change and the beginning of the line
   2. Multiply this distance by the scale and put that on your graph

Note:

* Rivers are assumed to be very shallow;  just put a little bump
