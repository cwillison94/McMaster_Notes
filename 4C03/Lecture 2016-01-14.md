## Hourglass Figure

**IP Core**: unreliable

**End-2-end argument**: if within the *core*, reduces host implementation complexity

* If every hop is reliable, then the end-2-end is reliable
* You don't need to have full reliability for a video stream because you can
  * interpolate frames
  * humans are tolerant to a certain level of quality compromise
* **Promiscuous mode**: captures other people's traffic
* **Time to live (TTL)**: number of hops until it dies
* Error messages can be dropped. They are sent by the router at which the TTL goes to 0
