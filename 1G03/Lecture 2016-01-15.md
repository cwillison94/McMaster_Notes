## Housekeeping

* SmartLearn
* Use Avenue Discussions
* Plate tectonic
* Do not upload lecture slides to websites, like OneClass: often teachers upload videos, images that they do not own
* Labs: groups of 3

## Minerals

Recall: rocks that form in nature include Igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic

**Metamorphic**: processes don't cause the rock to melt

**Crystalline**: repeating molecular structure, inorganic

**Rocks**: could have many types of minerals



Composition of elements of minerals help distinguish them

**Diagnostic properties**: attributes of a mineral that identifies it

* **Colour**: least dependable
* **Streak**: colour of powder when rubbed or scratched
* **Lustre**: how it reflects light (see using hand lens)
  * **Metallic**: weathered samples won't look metallic. You'll need to scrape for fresh
  * **Greasy**: (a.k.a. **pearly**) think salt
  * **Vitreous**: 
* **Hardness**: not how easy to break, but how easy to scratch
  * **Moh's hardness scale**: is non-linear, but handy. Note: fingernails are *2.5*
  * Be careful: your line could actually be your scratcher coming off
  * When minerals are of similar hardness, they mayâ€¦rub each other off
* **Habit**: 
  * **Euhedral**: even, smooth sides
  * **Anhedral**: when crystals grow and bump into each other
* **Taste**: dangerous, but *can* be diagnostic
* **Cleavage**: shape of break
  * need hand lens
  * Natural daylight is best for seeing stuff. Much better than fluorescent lights
  * Minerals have planes of weakness on which they will break. There could be multiple planes of weakness simultaneously. Sometimes, the sides of a crystal can appear to be a plane of weakness, but actually isn't
  * Look for repetition


* **Fracture**: direction of break
  * **Conchoidal**:
  * **Irregular**:
* Multiple refraction points
* Magnetism
* Acid test
