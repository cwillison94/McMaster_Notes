## Plate Tectonics

**Subduction**: when a plate goes under another, brings water down with it, and the boiling water melts the rocks above it as it goes down

### Boundaries

| Name       | Direction | Volcanoes     | [Earthquakes](##Earthquakes)             | Tsunamis      |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Divergent  | Apart     | Yeah          | Shallow                                  |               |
| Convergent | Together  | If subduction | If *subduction*, range from shallow in trenches to deep farther into the zone. Else, | If subduction |
| Transform  | Beside    | No            | Shallow                                  |               |

## Mineral Classification

### Intrusive

**Dikes** can form between **sill**, older rocks.

### Igneous



| Composition  | Extrusive           | Intrusive  |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ---------- |
| Felsic       | Rhyolite            | Granite    |
| Intermediate | Andesite            | Diorite    |
| Mafic        | Basalt              | Gabbro     |
| Ultramafic   | Komatiite (Picrite) | Peridotite |

* **Felsic**: rich in quartz, primarily on continents, typically granite, granodiorite
  * **Rhyolite**: continental crust
* **Mafic**: ocean crust

## Textures

**Phenocryst**: 

Types

* **Phaneritic**: intrusive
  * **Porphyritic**:
* **Aphanitic**: too small to see, extrusive

## Earthquakes

* Crust usually breaks in 3 cracks of ~$\frac{3\pi}{4}$

### Types of Waves

* P
* S
* â€‹

### Measuring

* 3/+ seismographs minimum
* Measure time between P and S waves
* In reality, all seismographs are useful
* **Strain energy**: built up tension on plates
* Scales:
  * **Richter magnitude scale**: logarithmic based on max amplitudes on seismographs
  * **Moment magnitude**: more accurate, related to fault rupture size and seismic energy
  * **Mercalli Intensity Scale**: *destructiveness* in proximity to population, infrastructure, time, rock types

### Minimizing

* In California, if a building isn't up to code, you must have a sign up that says the building isn't up to code
* **Liquefaction**: when sediments / soil temporarily acts like liquid because the particles break contacts with each other
* Control dams

### Tsunamis

* If *strain energy* builds up, when the subduction plate breaks, the top plate jumps up a bit
* Travel fastest in deep water
* Slows down as the friction of the waves hit the ground
