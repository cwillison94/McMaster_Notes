[TOC]

**Queuing theory**: estimation of the length of time necessary to stay in queue

[b]: bits
[B]: Bytes

* **Link Bandwidth** [R]: (bits per second)
* **Packet Length** [L]: (bits)
* **Average packet arrival rate** [a]: (packet/s)
* **Traffic Intensity**: L*a/R

Assuming infinitely sized queue

**Transmission Delay**: L/R time to send bits into link

* [d]: length of physical link
* [s]: propagation speed in medium (3*10^8 m/s)

**Propagation Delay**: d/s time to send message through physical medium

Roundabout equivalent of computing?? Internet takes advantage when there is free space

packets get dropped if network is congested

queue = buffer
