Rock moves heat worse than the atmosphere?

## Decompression melting

1. Hole for volcano decreases pressure.
2. Decreasing pressure lowers melting point
3. When water decreases melting point of rocks, it is well over 100C

## Igneous Rocks

### Texture

* The texture varies depending on how quickly the magma cooled
* **Intrusive**: when rocks *had time* to mix with other rocks before cooling
* **Extrusive**: minerals don't have time to get big because they cool so *quickly*, so you can't see them, except for *andesite*

### Mineral Content

chemistry and stuff

**Silicate**: a mineral with *silicate tetrahedra*

### Classification

* **Felsic**: 
  * **Granite-Rhyolite family**: rich in quartz, primarily on continents, typically granite, granodiorite
* **Intermediate**: 
  * **Andesite family**: volcanic island arcs
* **Mafic**:
  * **Basalt-Gabbro family**: ocean crust
* **Ultramafic**:

#### Ranges

* Attribute: Low —> High
* Fe, Mg: Felsic —> Ultramafic
* Density: Felsic —> Ultramafic
* Si, O: Ultramafic —> Felsic
* Temperature of formation: Felsic (700C) —> Ultramafic (1200C)



Pipe cells take an average of colours from a given region, so when whiter minerals have dark impurities, it's difficult to see how bright it is. However, when you have a black background, it gives it more perspective.
