## Plate Tectonics

* Composition of mantle has significantly more Fe and Mg than the crust
* Note: when waves transfer from one medium to another, they refract depending on the material



Sinking happens under subduction zones

**Hot spots**: outer core material gets superheated because of the cycles under the crust

**Mantle Plumes**: *hot spots* cause solid mantle to rise until it bumps up against crust, decreasing pressure as it goes up

* generates magma (low density)
* magma cuts through crust
* Location of mantle plumes can identify the direction of plate flow, like Hawaii

**Slump**: solidified *mantle plumes*

Coral reefs love *slumps*

**Wilson cycles**: Pangea was not even the first **supercontinent**
